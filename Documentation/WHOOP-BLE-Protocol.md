# WHOOP BLE Protocol

Reverse-engineered BLE protocol for WHOOP fitness straps (Gen 4 Harvard, Maverick/Goose, Puffin generations). Findings from APK decompilation (v5.439.0), PacketLogger captures, and live device probing (March 2026).

## GATT Services

| Hardware Gen | Service UUID |
|---|---|
| Gen 4 (Harvard) | `61080001-8d6d-82b8-614a-1c8cb0f8dcc6` |
| Maverick/Goose | `fd4b0001-cce1-4033-93ce-002d5875f58a` |
| Puffin | `11500001-6215-11ee-8c99-0242ac120002` |

## Characteristics

All generations use the same suffix pattern — replace the `0001` in the service UUID:

| Suffix | Name | Direction | Properties |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0002` | CMD_TO_STRAP | Phone → Strap | Write, WriteNoResponse |
| `0003` | CMD_FROM_STRAP | Strap → Phone | Notify |
| `0004` | EVENTS_FROM_STRAP | Strap → Phone | Notify |
| `0005` | DATA_FROM_STRAP | Strap → Phone | Notify |
| `0007` | MEMFAULT | Strap → Phone | Notify |

## Frame Format

### Maverick/Puffin (8-byte header, confirmed)

```
[SOF: 0xAA] [version: 0x01] [payloadLen: u16 LE] [role1: u8] [role2: u8] [headerCRC16: u16 LE]
[command/data payload: payloadLen - 4 bytes]
[payloadCRC32: u32 LE]
```

- **Header CRC16**: CRC16-MODBUS (polynomial 0xA001, init 0xFFFF) of the first 6 header bytes, stored as u16 LE at bytes 6-7
- **Payload CRC32**: Standard IEEE 802.3 CRC32 (`java.util.zip.CRC32`) of the command/data bytes only (NOT including the CRC32 itself), stored as u32 LE at the end of the payload
- `payloadLen` **includes** the 4-byte CRC32 trailer
- `role1` = 0x00, `role2` = 0x01 for command frames (from `AbstractC15395a` in APK)
- Source: `dm0/C15399e.java` (MaverickPacketFrame) in decompiled APK

**Verified**: built frames match PacketLogger capture byte-for-byte. Example:
```
Header:  aa 01 0c 00 00 01 e7 41   (CRC16 of aa010c000001 = 0x41E7)
Payload: 23 f1 6a 01 01 00 00 00   (TOGGLE_IMU_MODE, seq=0xF1)
CRC32:   58 e9 61 fc               (CRC32 of payload = 0xFC61E958)
```

### Gen 4 Harvard (5-byte header)

```
[SOF: 0xAA] [version: u8] [payloadLen: u16 LE] [headerCRC8: u8]
[payload: payloadLen bytes]
```

## Command Payload Format

```
[packetType: 0x23 or 0x25] [seqNum: u8] [commandByte: u8] [params...]
```

- `0x23` for COMMAND (Gen4/Maverick)
- `0x25` for PUFFIN_COMMAND
- `seqNum` increments per command sent
- `params` vary by command — e.g., TOGGLE_IMU_MODE uses `[revision=0x01, enable=0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00]`

The command payload (including params) is followed by a CRC32 trailer to form the full frame payload.

## R21 Raw Data Format (type 0x2B, record type 21)

1236-byte payload containing 100 accelerometer samples and 100 gyroscope samples:

| Payload Offset | Size | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | Packet type (0x2B) |
| 1 | 1 | Record type (21 = 0x15) |
| 16 | 2 | countA — accelerometer sample count (u16 LE, typically 100) |
| 20 | 200 | ax samples (100 × i16 LE) |
| 220 | 200 | ay samples (100 × i16 LE) |
| 420 | 200 | az samples (100 × i16 LE) |
| 622 | 2 | countB — gyroscope sample count (u16 LE) |
| 632 | 200 | gx samples (100 × i16 LE) |
| 832 | 200 | gy samples (100 × i16 LE) |
| 1032 | 200 | gz samples (100 × i16 LE) |

- Sensor range: ±8g (1g ≈ 4096 LSB)
- Sample rate: ~50-100 Hz (100 samples per frame, frames at ~1Hz)
- Accelerometer and gyroscope arrays are stored separately (not interleaved)

## Standard Sync Sequence

The WHOOP app performs this sequence on connection:

1. `GET_HELLO (0x91)` — handshake (or `GET_HELLO_HARVARD (0x23)` for Gen4)
2. `START_FF_KEY_EXCHANGE (0x75)` — begin feature flag exchange
3. `GET_FF_VALUE (0x76)` × N — read feature flags (`enable_r22_packets`, `enable_r22_v2_packets`, etc.)
4. `START_DEVICE_CONFIG_KEY_EXCHANGE (0x73)` — begin device config exchange
5. `SEND_NEXT_DEVICE_CONFIG (0x74)` × N — push config values
6. `GET_DATA_RANGE (0x22)` — ask strap what data it has stored
7. `SEND_HISTORICAL_DATA (0x16)` — request historical data replay
8. Strap streams `HISTORICAL_DATA (0x2F)` + `REALTIME_RAW_DATA (0x2B)` + `CONSOLE_LOGS (0x32)` packets
9. App sends `HISTORICAL_DATA_RESULT (0x17)` ACKs for each chunk
10. Concurrent: strap streams `REALTIME_DATA (0x28)` with HR + orientation quaternion at ~1 Hz

## Authentication / Bonding

The strap requires BLE bonding before accepting any commands:

- **Unbonded connections** (e.g., macOS ble-probe): All commands return `PUFFIN_COMMAND_RESPONSE (0x26)` with error code `0x049c` (1180 decimal), regardless of command type, format, or CRC
- **Bonded connections** (iOS piggybacking on WHOOP app): Commands are accepted (0x24 ACK). The WHOOP app establishes the bond during initial strap setup. iOS shares the bond across all apps at the OS level.
- **Bonding is at the OS level** on iOS — `retrieveConnectedPeripherals(withServices:)` returns the strap when the WHOOP app has connected it

## Passive Data Capture (No Command Needed)

R21 raw data (type 0x2B) flows passively during the WHOOP app's normal sync session. Our app can capture accelerometer data by:

1. Finding the strap via `retrieveConnectedPeripherals` (requires WHOOP app to be connected)
2. Calling `connect()` to establish our own logical connection (shares the bonded BLE link)
3. Subscribing to `DATA_FROM_STRAP (0005)` notifications
4. Parsing incoming R21 frames

No `TOGGLE_IMU_MODE` command is needed for this approach. The IMU is already active during sync.

## Compact REALTIME_DATA (0x28, 24-byte payload, record type 2)

The strap continuously streams compact 0x28 packets at ~1 Hz, even outside sync sessions. Decoded from live device capture (March 2026):

| Payload Offset | Size | Field | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | Packet type (`0x28`) | |
| 1 | 1 | Record type (`0x02`) | |
| 2-5 | 4 | Timestamp (u32 LE) | Unix epoch seconds. **Different offset from other packet types** (which use offset 7). |
| 6-7 | 2 | Sub-sequence / flags | Varies per session |
| **8** | **1** | **Heart Rate (bpm)** | Confirmed 60-62 bpm in resting capture. 0 when strap has no reading. |
| **9** | **1** | **Valid flag** | `0x01` = valid HR + R-R reading, `0x00` = no valid reading |
| **10-11** | **2** | **R-R interval (u16 LE, ms)** | Beat-to-beat timing. ~900-1050 ms at resting HR. 0 when flag=0. |
| 12-17 | 6 | Reserved (zeros) | |
| 18 | 1 | Constant `0x01` | |
| 19 | 1 | Constant `0x00` | |
| 20-23 | 4 | CRC32 / checksum | Changes every packet |

**Key finding**: These packets stream continuously — they are the live HR feed that the WHOOP app displays on its home screen. Our iOS app receives them by piggybacking on the WHOOP app's BLE connection.

## Full REALTIME_DATA (0x28, 116-byte payload)

During active sync sessions, the strap sends a larger 116-byte variant:

| Payload Offset | Size | Field | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 22 | 1 | Heart Rate (bpm) | Validated 66-89 range in PacketLogger capture |
| 23-40 | 18 | Optical/PPG data | Partially understood, raw preserved |
| 41-44 | 4 | Quaternion W (float32 LE) | Strap's own sensor fusion |
| 45-48 | 4 | Quaternion X (float32 LE) | |
| 49-52 | 4 | Quaternion Y (float32 LE) | |
| 53-56 | 4 | Quaternion Z (float32 LE) | |

The full format only appears during active sync (when the WHOOP app sends `SEND_HISTORICAL_DATA`). Outside sync, only the compact 24-byte format streams.

## HISTORICAL_DATA (0x2F, 116-byte payload, record type 18)

Historical data replayed during sync. Contains the same sensor data as the compact 0x28 but with a longer header and additional fields:

| Payload Offset | Size | Field | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | Packet type (`0x2F`) | |
| 1 | 1 | Record type (`0x12` = 18) | |
| 2-3 | 2 | Sequence (u16 LE) | |
| 4-5 | 2 | Constant (`0x1850`) | |
| 6-7 | 2 | Sub-sequence (u16 LE) | |
| 8-13 | 6 | Session/device ID (constant per session) | |
| **14** | **1** | **Heart Rate (bpm)** | Confirmed from capture (values 60-73) |
| **15** | **1** | **Flag** | 1=valid HR+RR, 2=valid HR+RR+extra, 0=no reading |
| **16-17** | **2** | **R-R interval (u16 LE, ms)** | ~900-1060 ms at resting HR |
| 18-19 | 2 | Extra data | Non-zero when flag=2 |
| 20-23 | 4 | Reserved | |
| 24-25 | 2 | Metadata flags | |
| 26-27 | 2 | Changing data | |
| 28 | 1 | Session marker | |
| **29** | **1** | **Smoothed HR (bpm)** | Tracks ~2-3 bpm below byte 14 |
| 30-32 | 3 | Padding | |
| **33-36** | **4** | **Quaternion W (float32 LE)** | Confirmed unit quaternion (magnitude ~1.00) |
| **37-40** | **4** | **Quaternion X (float32 LE)** | |
| **41-44** | **4** | **Quaternion Y (float32 LE)** | |
| **45-48** | **4** | **Quaternion Z (float32 LE)** | |
| 49-115 | 67 | Config/metadata | Partially decoded |

## Persistent Config Keys (from firmware console logs)

The WHOOP app pushes 17 persistent config keys to the strap during sync via `SEND_NEXT_DEVICE_CONFIG (0x74)`:

| Index | Key | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `general_ab_test` | 2 | A/B test group |
| 1 | `enable_r22_packets` | 2 | R22 optical data format v1 |
| 2 | `enable_r22_v2_packets` | 2 | R22 optical data format v2 |
| 3 | `enable_r22_v3_packets` | 2 | R22 optical data format v3 |
| 4 | `enable_r22_v4_packets` | **1** | R22 optical data format v4 (only one set to 1) |
| 5 | `enable_r22_v5_packets` | 2 | R22 optical data format v5 |
| 6 | `enable_r22_v6_packets` | 2 | R22 optical data format v6 |
| 7 | `enable_r22_v8_packets` | 2 | R22 optical data format v8 (no v7) |
| 8 | `make_hrfm_visible` | 2 | HR frequency measurement visibility |
| 9 | `disable_pip_r26_packets` | ? | Pulse information packets |
| 10 | `wear_detect_bias` | ? | Wear detection sensitivity |
| 11 | `enable_pdaf_walk_det` | ? | Walk detection |
| 12 | `enable_maverick_model` | 1 | Maverick hardware model |
| 13 | `hr_ch_switching` | 2 | HR channel switching |
| 14 | `ir_hw_switching` | ? | IR hardware switching |
| 15 | `enable_passive_strap_fit_gen5` | ? | Passive strap fit detection |
| 16 | `enable_sig11_during_sleep` | 2 | Signal 11 during sleep |

**R22 = optical sensor data packets.** The firmware logs show "No active optical data collection sources" during daytime captures. Optical collection activates during sleep/recovery for SpO2 and skin temp measurement.

## Commands for Enhanced Data Capture

| Command | Byte | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| TOGGLE_REALTIME_HR (0x03) | Sent on connect | Continuous 1 Hz HR streaming beyond sync |
| TOGGLE_OPTICAL_MODE (0x6C) | Sent on connect | Enable raw PPG data in 0x28 packets |
| TOGGLE_IMU_MODE (0x6A) | Sent on streaming start | Raw IMU streaming |
| SEND_R10_R11_REALTIME (0x3F) | Sent on connect | Request full realtime data (did not upgrade to 116-byte format in testing) |

All commands are sent automatically when the iOS app connects to the strap and are ACK'd (0x24 response).

## What We Currently Capture

| Data | Packet | Rate | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Heart Rate (bpm) | 0x28 compact, byte 8 | 1 Hz | Parsed by native code only; **not uploaded or stored** because it is device-derived |
| R-R Interval (ms) | 0x28 compact, bytes 10-11 | 1 Hz | **Stored** in metric stream `rr_interval_ms` channel |
| Accelerometer (3-axis) | 0x2B R21 | ~100 Hz | **Stored** in `inertial_measurement_unit_sample` |
| Gyroscope (3-axis) | 0x2B R21 | ~100 Hz | **Stored** in `inertial_measurement_unit_sample` |
| Orientation quaternion | 0x2F R18, bytes 33-48 | During sync | **Stored** in metric stream `orientation` channel when present |
| Historical R-R | 0x2F R18, bytes 16-17 | During sync | **Stored** in metric stream `rr_interval_ms` channel; historical heart rate is not stored |

## Next Steps: SpO2 and Skin Temperature

SpO2 and skin temperature are **not available in any packet type we've observed**. They are derived from raw optical sensor data (R22 packets) which the strap only collects during sleep/recovery periods. The firmware logs confirm: "No active optical data collection sources" during daytime.

To get R22 optical data:
1. **Overnight BLE capture** — run PacketLogger or our iOS app during sleep when optical sensors are active
2. **Parse R22 packets** — the `enable_r22_v4_packets` config key is set to 1 (enabled) while others are set to 2 (different format?), suggesting v4 is the active optical format
3. **Decode the optical payload** — R22 likely contains raw multi-wavelength PPG data (green, red, IR) from which SpO2 and skin temp can be derived
4. **Alternative**: Continue using the WHOOP API for daily SpO2 (`spo2_percentage`) and skin temp (`skin_temp_celsius`) from recovery scores — these are already synced
